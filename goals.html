  <h2>How NSU and Other Organizations Are Helping</h2>
  <p>NSU’s cybersecurity program gives me a well-rounded foundation in both technical and business-related skills. The hands-on projects and access to virtual labs let me simulate real-world cyber scenarios. Being surrounded by peers and faculty who genuinely care about student success has made a big difference.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of school, I’ve benefited a lot from organizations like Blacks in Technology (BIT), which has connected me with professionals already working in the industry. I also draw motivation from YouTube creators and mentors who share their IT journeys. These resources remind me that consistency beats perfection and that the path to success in tech is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
  
  <p>With the combined support of my school, my community, and my own drive, I feel equipped to chase bigger goals while helping others rise with me along the way.</p>
