  <h1>Joseph Jordan - Professional Page</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Joseph Jordan.</p> 
  <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
<p>I'm currently working toward a Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Computer Information Systems</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> at Northwestern State University of Louisiana. My coursework combines technical training with business principles, giving me a strong foundation in both programming and strategic thinking.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve taken classes in cybersecurity fundamentals, information systems, networking, and business law. I enjoy learning how technology can solve real-world problems — especially when it comes to protecting data and systems in today’s digital age. Each course is helping me sharpen my analytical thinking and expand my skill set.</p>

<p>I'm also on a mission to maintain a high GPA and make the most out of every semester. I've made the President’s List for academic excellence and I actively participate in class discussions, group projects, and assignments that involve real-world scenarios. I’ve developed a reputation as someone who’s reliable, motivated, and always willing to help others — especially when it comes to tech.</p>

<p>What I really appreciate about NSU is the support system. Whether it’s professors who genuinely care or classmates who share my ambition, I’ve found an environment that encourages both personal and professional growth. Being a part of this program is giving me the confidence to take on complex problems, pursue certifications, and prepare for my future career in cybersecurity.</p>

  <h2>Welcome!</h2>

  <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy staying active through weightlifting, watching UFC, creating motivational content on TikTok, and building side projects in tech. I’ve also been recognized for my consistent work ethic, 5-star customer service skills, and leadership on both academic and personal levels.</p>

  <p>Whether it's securing networks, building web projects, or helping others navigate tech challenges, I believe in bringing energy, excellence, and empathy to everything I do.</p>
